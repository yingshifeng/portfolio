<h3>Gamebox,Guoxun Lingyi and Ying, Arduino Project, 2019</h3>
<p>This is a Game Box for fun (could play two games: 21 Points and Ultrasonic Face). For the first game --- 21 Points, it made of a voice sensor, six LEDs, and an LED Matrix. Two or more people could play this game. The rule is every time the player claps his / her hand, the LEDs and LED Matrix will randomly show their works. The LED lights up, and the LED Matrix shows the numbers. Adding those two numbers together, the player can choose to keep clapping to heat 21 or stop there. If the number exceeds 21, then "bomb!" you lose.

For the second game --- Ultrasonic Face, it mainly made of a distance, an LED Matrix. The game rule is that when one player claps his / her hand, the LEDs and LED Matrix will randomly show their works. The LED lights up , and the LED Matrix shows the numbers. Adding those two numbers together. Another player does the same way, who gets the bigger point who step forward while the Trophy is showing bigger in the processing window and there will be a smile face show on the LED Matrix. The one who gets the biggest Trophy, the one is the winner.</p>
