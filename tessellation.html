    <h2>Little Wood Box Guoxun Wu.</h2>
    <p>In our group, we did four shapes of squares with different design and they can fit each other with notches. My group member Yingshi made the inside square shape that able to stick with each other. Our concept is inspired by traditional
      furniture work. They usually can solid stick together without any assistance. But the size and measurement is the key. Then I design another square shape that fit her design and covers her shape with the inter-middle notches. In the first
      round of Laser cutting, the process very well, the only mistake we had is the thickness of the wood panel that we used is a little thinner than our design.</p>
