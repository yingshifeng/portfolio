<h1>Story:</h1>
<p>Tiger Tallies, were two-piece fu formed in the shape of a tiger. The material from which tiger tallies were created varied through Chinese history. It were used by a king or emperor to command and dispatch the army. The right piece was retained in the central government while the left piece was issued to the local officials or commanders. If someone wanted to dispatch the troops from a certain area, he had to show the right piece of the tiger tally in order to obtain authorization; both pieces of the tally had to match each other.</p>
<br>
<p>In my Tiger Tallies design, I created a key that hidding inside of two pieces fu shapes. The person who can have these two shape then he can use it as a key to enter my treasure.</p>

<h1>Tiger Tallies</h1>
<p>In this art piece, I use fusion 360 to modelling a tiger shape, then shalled it and created web inside of the body. Also created a handle that join the key componet, it let people can control the key in and out. In the end, it printed out from the Ulitimaker cura machine and become a nice plastic tiger tallies.</p>
