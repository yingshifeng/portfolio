    <h1>"Learning Desk", Animation, 30 seconds,Yingshi Feng, 2018</h1>
    <p>In my animation artwork, “Learning Desk,” I created an animation of three objects jumping down the desk, then flowing into the wind and spinning. The idea of this artwork is inspired by the time when I was working on it: I was sitting in coffee shop with my pen, cup, and a book on the table. And I was a little bit tired and dizzy. Afterward, I wanted to give the reader a unique feeling about the surging feeling by spinning around the objects again and again. Hence, I was modeling the pen, cup, and book into 3D space, and I think it would come with the exact look the same as the real item, so I took a picture of those and downloaded texture from a website, I created an authentic look to the objects by assigning a new surface in 3D space. After the modeling, I keyframed the position and rotation of each object, made it as a spin cycle animation. Also, I wanted to enhance the strength of swirling feeling, so I moved these objects back and forth, spinning them around and randomly rotating them. It shows the rhythms the mind expect. In the end, I added sound to it to give a better feeling.</p>

    <h1>"Playing", Animation, 30 Seconds,Yingshi Feng, 2018</h1>
<p>After the experience of animation progressed, I planned to make a new animation with a character. I wanted to show the difference between virtual and reality. However, I used my self-portrait as the main Character, but this time I am using a new software called “Make Human,” it provides a more realistic setting for an element and creating a perfectly realistic human body. And then I created the self-portrait by referring to all facial and body features, converting it into 3D space. I created a clown job for myself, stand in front of the amusement park, playing with the acrobatics. It’s a cycle animation as well, which repeats thought the ball. In this artwork, I tend to focus on the characters movement, which I need to create the skeleton of a human body, add HK handle of it, adjust all the bone orientations, then bind to mesh and to rig the mesh. It gives a great chance to make a naturally human.</p>

    <h1>"Planet", Animation, 58 Seconds, Yingshi Feng, 2019</h1>
    <p>I really like the universe since I was a child, the dark and blinking stars give me a feeling of fantasy and a sense of curiosity. Therefore, I created a dark black color background universe. Then I modeled many spheres like the stars. I used my self-portrait made from “Make Human” as my character. In the beginning, my character put on the VR glasses to travel around the universe from first person view. And then I used different materials and textures in each sphere, and it surprised me that the texture gave more freshness in this new universe. That's why I always wanted to make some fantasy thing that we cannot do in real space. Since I have a strong passion and talent in animation. I will keep working at this direction in future. I connect myself to the virtual space step by step, I believed that one day I can be a good animator.</p>
