    <h3>"Draw Your World"</h3>
    <p>"Draw Your World" is an interactive projection wall canvas that is written using mathematical algorithms. The viewer interacts with a sound detect function to write random lines inside of the canvas that represents human behaviors and how it
      impacts our planet.</p><br>
    <p>In this project,Draw Your World, was a code basic interactive animation that uses P5.Js and detects sound with microphone plug in to control the drawing function. The lines will represent human behaviors that also hold specific meaning for
      all the viewers. As a result, computers draw the earth for every individual visitor with their own understanding. The work is a combination of coding and projection installation, it will project on the wall on a large scale and shows as
      animation in the gallery space.
    </p><br>
    <p>Recently I just finished the basic part of coding, and I already have done the first test and it works well. Now, I am working on adding more functions as well as approaching my final goal. However, I am still looking for how to present it in
      the gallery, such as how to project the full screen and installation part.
