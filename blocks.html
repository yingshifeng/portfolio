  <p><b>Artist statement:</b> In this project, We come up the idea together which is we think San Jose State is a campus open to the public. This sometimes results in crime on campus. In more recent years, more cameras and blue phones were added
    but sometimes it seems like its more for the facade of safety and deferral of crime than actual security. We feel this way because one time we used the phone when our friend hurt her foot and security
    never showed up for 45 minutes to help give her a ride to the garage.</p>
